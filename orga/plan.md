## Introduction
* short introduction of who we are and what will we present


## Presentation Overview
* show them what we will come next

## Project Roadmap
* showcase the Project Roadmap
* from start to finish line

## Organize the project
* what tool do we use for that
* and why do we use it (pro&contra)
* some github project screenshots

## Scope(s)
* what is our scope
* what was some idea what we had in first steps
  - what went wrong

## Find a dataset!
* the journy of finding the right datasets
* our datasets

## EDA
* how we use EDA for our datasets

## Algorithm 
* our algorithm
* what is kNN algorithm
* how do we implement it in our scope

## Live Demo or Code Screenshot 
* need to decide which way would we like to implement
* if we use LiveDemo then rehearsal it before many times
* if we use Screenshot, then prepare the right screenshot
  - with some short explaination

## next steps
* what will we do next?
  - which part of the code need which improvement
  - what need to be fixed
  - which dataset would we like to have for the improvements

## learnings
* which experience do we gained through this project
* which learning would we like to give to the others (new joiners)
* what we would like to change, if we could start the project from new
