# **Project Scope: Analysis of Germany's Suitability for 2030 Electrified Infrastructure Goals**

In this project, our objective is to examine Germany's suitability for achieving the defined 2030 infrastructure goals related to electrified vehicles. We will conduct an analysis using various data sources to provide a comprehensive assessment. The primary goals and activities of the project are as follows:

## Data Source Analysis and Evaluation:

Investigate different data sources to gain insights into the current state of electrified vehicles in Germany.
Analyze the growth of plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles (EVs) in Germany since their introduction.
Capture of Public Charging Stations:

Compile a comprehensive list of public charging stations across Germany.
Capture precise location information of existing charging stations to enable accurate mapping.
Forecast of Future Growth:

Based on analyzed data and trends, calculate the expected growth of plug-in hybrids and EVs in the upcoming years.
Derive insights into the increasing demand for charging infrastructure.
Location Analysis for New Charging Stations:

Develop a model to identify optimal locations for installing new charging stations.
Map regions with potentially higher demand for charging infrastructure to facilitate targeted initiatives.
Results Presentation and Documentation:

Create a comprehensive presentation of the findings, showcasing Germany's suitability for the defined infrastructure goals.
Document the methodology, data sources, and assumptions for transparency and reproducibility.
Through this focused analysis, we aim to gain valuable insights into the current and future requirements for electromobility in Germany. The combination of data analysis, forecasts, and location analysis will enable us to provide well-informed recommendations for achieving the 2030 infrastructure goals.
