# Project Scope: German EV Charger Map Project (ChargeIT)

The German EV Charger Map Project is an ambitious undertaking aimed at simplifying electric vehicle (EV) charging across Germany. This project is a work in progress, with the goal of creating an application that streamlines the EV charging experience. By utilizing real-time data, route planning, and advanced EV range calculations, we aim to provide EV drivers with a valuable tool for their journeys. 
The primary goals and activities of the project are as follows:

## Data Source Analysis and Evaluation

#### Investigation of Different Data Sources
To kickstart the German EV Charger Map Project, our initial step involved a comprehensive investigation of various data sources to gain valuable insights into the electric vehicle (EV) landscape and the status of charging stations in Germany. This involved:

Data Collection: We scoured publicly available datasets, consulted governmental records, and engaged with charging network providers to gather data on charging stations and their attributes. This process allowed us to understand the diversity of charging infrastructure across the country.

EV Market Analysis: We studied market reports and analyzed data on the adoption and types of electric cars in Germany. This information helped us understand the evolving EV ecosystem and the needs of EV drivers.

#### Compilation of Charging Stations
Upon completing the data source investigation, we compiled a comprehensive list of all charging stations in Germany. This aggregation involved:

Data Integration: We integrated data from various sources to create a unified and structured database of charging stations. This database includes details such as station locations, charging speeds, connector types, and real-time availability.

Quality Assurance: To ensure data accuracy, we implemented rigorous quality assurance measures. This included data validation against multiple sources, verification of station coordinates, and regular updates to reflect changes in the charging network.

#### Precise Location Information
To enable precise mapping of charging stations, we focused on capturing and maintaining accurate location information for each station. This involved:

GPS Coordinates: We collected GPS coordinates for each charging station to pinpoint their exact locations. These coordinates are essential for creating an interactive map for users to find charging stations easily.

Location Updates: Our system is designed to regularly update station locations to reflect any changes or new additions. This ensures that users always have access to the most current information.

#### Route Planning and Reach Calculation
One of the key features of the German EV Charger Map Project is the ability to plan routes and estimate the reachable charging stations. This involves:

Algorithm Development: We've developed a sophisticated algorithm that takes user input, including the starting location, destination, and the estimated range of the user's EV, to create an overview of charging stations that are reachable along the selected route.

By following these steps, the German EV Charger Map Project aims to provide EV drivers in Germany with a powerful tool for locating charging stations and planning their routes, all while considering the reach of their electric vehicles. We continue to refine and expand our data sources and algorithms to enhance the accuracy and utility of our service.
