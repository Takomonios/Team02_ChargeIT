# team02 HI GUYS!
this will be our Team project repo with project overview!
If you have never use GitHub before -> go to project -> choose "project team2" -> choose ticket "get into Github" there I have provide 2 short youtube links, where some basics will be explain.

first meetup is on 06.07.2023 at 18:30 in our Teams Chat - at 19:00 we have our TechLabs Event

Some rolls that we can have as a Team:
[] Timeline Manager / Project Manager
[] backend dev (create pupeline/ ETL/ aggr. & predic.)
[] frontend dev (create dashboard base on PowerBi, aggr. data, create POC)

We will divide as a Team roll (these rolls is not fixed, it will rotate - so that everyone will get experince of each rolls.
Also each Team need to document every (important) steps - so in the end we can sell our story :D 

Some task need to be done until the end of July:
[] search dataset that we can use
[] create a good usecase for that dataset
[] beginn create a POC for that
[] create documentation 


IÂ´m looking forward of you guys! 
lets have a great project experience together!
