# team02 HI GUYS!
Userstory/Scope of our project:
Everyone would like to start buy an electric car, if we all have the right amount of money for that, but is the infrastructure in germany ready for that?

We can provide an analytic overview and do some prediction about this topic.

We will create a overview about all the e car chargestation in germany and compared it with all the ecar user in germany, therefor we can estimate the amount of chargestation that need to be there - to satisfied amount of all ecars in germany.

We also can predict the peak of the station and do some prediction of how much energy do the peak load of energy is and could it be handle by the infrastructure without an blackout and is it possible to do it better with some solutions idea.

Overall we want to display the "current" situation of the e charge station infrastructuer in germany, compare the number of e charge that is already install in gasstation with all the gasstation. Also we have to estimate of the energy that is used for 1 full charge to estimate the amount of energy that is "daily" needed. Also the number of e cars in germany was registered in 1-3 years. Therefore we can do some prediction about the future amount of e car that will be there and how many e charger should be in the gasstation in germany.

its just a rought idea but will defined it later on!


IÂ´m looking forward of you guys! 
lets have a great project experience together!
